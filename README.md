# Pong-game
A ping-pong game made with Python using the Pygame library, that can be played with two players. The game was made using classes and the principles of object-oriented programming. There is also a score marker on the top corners which gets incremented every time the ball touches the wall past the paddle on the other side. Whichever player gets to a score of 11 first wins.
